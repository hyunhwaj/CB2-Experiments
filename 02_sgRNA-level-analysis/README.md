## 02_sgRNA-level-analysis

There are three different subdirectories in the directory. `dat` contains files which are necessary to execute the scripts in the directory, and `figures` contains generated figures by the scripts. `scripts-for-analysis` contains snippets to parse and execute CB<sup>2</sup>. 

`*.R` files are executable files and you can execute the scripts in Rstudio, or run `Rscript <file-name-of-the-script.R`. The following table describles the function of each script and what will be generated by the script:

File name      | Executable  | Function
---------------|-------------|------------------------------
draw-fig-S1.R  | Yes         | The script to create mean-variance plots to claim CRISPR pooled data can be under/over-dispersed. 
draw-fig-S14.R | Yes         | The script to generate FPR plots of non-targeting sgRNA analysis using Sanson et al.'s data.
draw-fig-S15.R | Yes         | The script to create Heatmaps and Venn diagrams to reveal discrepancy of sgRNA statistics between CB<sup>2</sup> and MAGeCK
draw-fig3.R    | Yes         | The script to generate FPR plots of non-targeting sgRNA analysis using Parnas et al.'s data.
draw-fig4.R    | Yes         | The script to create Heatmaps and Venn diagrams to reveal discrepancy of sgRNA statistics between CB<sup>2</sup> and MAGeCK.

## RRA experiment

This directory contains data (generated by MAGeCK) and scripts for the experiment to compare Fisher's method and alpha-RRA (Robust Ranking Aggregation).

the following command has generated `sample1.*.txt` files (output files of MAGeCK):

```
mageck test -k input.tsv -c B1,B2,B3 -t A1,A2,A3
```

To create the plot of the comparison, please execute `01_run-RRA.R` and `02_draw-lineplot.R`, sequentially. `fig-RRA` will be created in `01_gene-level-analysis/figures` after running both scripts.
